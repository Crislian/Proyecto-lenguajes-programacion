# Java Data structures visualization

The goal of this project is provide a visualization of multiple data structures interpreting Java 7 code wrote by an user.

## Limits

The application is limited to interpret the following Classes: ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, PriorityQueue and the interfaces: List and Queue. The Data Types that are going to store these Structures are: Integer, Character, Boolean, Double, Float. Moreover, the program s not going to interprete the own declared classes and other methods differents to the main method.

Additionally, it is assumed that the code is semantically correct, and it is going show you if there are lexical and sintactic errors. 

The folder Examples-testing contains some examples of code that can be interpreted by the application. 

## How to use it

1. There will be a text area where you can write your code (just into the mathod called main).
2. When you stop type, the application will wait 1.5 seconds and it will start to interpret your code showing you if you have lexical or sintactical error and you can watch the error in the left side putting the cursor over the red square.
3. If the interpretation exits succesfully you will see a green line on the code which is showing in which line are you.
4. Below the code editor, you can see a green slider to move through the code and visualize your code in the points that you want.
5. The visualization of the data structures and variables will appear bellow the slider.
